	<p>Browsers are normally set to print a header and footer on each page, typically showing the page title, page number, URL and date. Their font and size is usually based on the default font and size you have set for the Web page itself (see above) and can't be changed independently. If you don't want headers and footers printed at all, you can suppress them.
	Print headers/footers in Internet Explorer</p>

	<p>Use the File Menu and select Page Setup. To suppress headers and footers, delete the contents of the Header and Footer boxes. Type them in again to restore.
	Print headers/footers in Opera</p>

	<p>Use the File Menu and select Print Options. Toggle headers/footers on or off.
	Print headers/footers in Firefox</p>

	<p>Use the File Menu and select Page Setup. On the Margins & Header/Footer tab, set each item as required.</p>
